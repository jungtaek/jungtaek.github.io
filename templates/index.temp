            <p class="paragraph-100">
                Jungtaek Kim is a research associate at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison, working with Prof. Kangwook Lee. Previously, he was a postdoctoral associate at the University of Pittsburgh, working with Prof. Paul W. Leu, Prof. Satish Iyengar, Prof. Lucas Mentch, and Prof. Oliver Hinder, and a postdoctoral researcher at POSTECH in the group of Prof. Minsu Cho. He received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering from POSTECH in 2015 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from POSTECH in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. Seungjin Choi and Prof. Minsu Cho. During his Ph.D. program, he interned at Vector Institute and SigOpt (acquired by Intel). His internship at Vector Institute was carried out under the supervision of Prof. Graham W. Taylor, and he worked with Dr. Michael McCourt at SigOpt. He presented his work as a first author or co-author at top-tier machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS, UAI, and ICLR. He has also served as a program committee member or reviewer for several machine learning conferences, including NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS, UAI, and ICLR. His main research interests are statistical machine learning, Bayesian optimization, large language models, and sequential assembly.
